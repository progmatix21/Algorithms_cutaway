# Algorithms cutaway

Algorithms cutaway is a repository created to understand the working of algorithms.

Usually, algorithms, the way they are implemented work magically and give us a result.  The only way to
understand them is through their code.  Wouldn't it be convenient for our understanding and study to
actually observe them at work?  What we would need is a program that progressively illustrates the important 
working steps.  Here is where we find the 'cutaway' of algorithms very useful.

We start by creating cutaway versions of two sort algorithms and one search algorithm.
